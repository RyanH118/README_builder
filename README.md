# README Builder
        
## Description

I was motivated in this challenge to create a README Builder that creates a README.md for future projects. The goal I wanted to complete is to use inquirer to ask me a series of questions and I input my answers. Then when I am done with the questions I get a "success!" message and a README.md file is created with my answers. I learned how to use node.js, inquirer and even colors. When using node.js I learned how to create a package with npm init and how to install other modules like inquirer and colors. By using inquirer I learned how to get my terminal to ask me question and I can give it answers to then make a file. I learned how to get my questions text to have a color.
